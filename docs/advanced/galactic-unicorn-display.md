# Galactic Unicorn display

The Pico W/Pico 2 W board drives the fixed 53x11 panel using the display half
of Pimoroni pico **v1.23.0** (`3440ab232cdc2b019bb8d16f67b0448502efd9dc`, MIT).
Audio and pico_graphics are not included. See `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

## Height and wiring

`panelHeight` defaults to **11**. **8** produces a 53x8 canvas letterboxed on
physical rows **1–8** (zero-based); rows **0, 9, 10** remain dark. Any other
height uses 11 and logs a warning at board startup. Width is always 53, with
one panel and fixed wiring (arbitrary matrix layouts are not supported).

Clock/data/latch/blank are GPIO 13/14/15/16, row selects GPIO 17–20. The
physical stream reverses both axes, matching Pimoroni's original driver.

## Refresh and color

One dynamically claimed PIO SM and two chained DMA channels continuously
refresh fourteen binary-weighted bit planes without CPU refresh interrupts.
PIO1 is preferred to leave PIO0 instruction memory for CYW43; allocation checks
both free SMs and program space, and can fall back to PIO0. The startup log
prints the actual display PIO/SM and DMA channels. The Pico variant's early
`init_cyw43_wifi` call is deferred with a linker wrapper until after display
startup. The radio log reports newly claimed PIO/SMs from the SDK allocation
bitmap, without depending on CYW43's private bus structure. After the Wi-Fi join
or AP startup, a bounded DMA-progress probe logs `refresh advancing` (or a
failure). This checks DMA movement, not panel wiring or visual quality; a human
must still verify that the boot animation keeps moving while Wi-Fi connects.

Two aligned 9,240-byte buffers (18,480 bytes total) fit in static RAM. `show()`
packs the inactive buffer, publishes its aligned address, then waits until DMA
has begun reading it before reusing the old buffer. The control channel only
loads a new address at a full-frame boundary. The PIO FIFO preserves ordering
across that boundary. Calls must be serialized on core 0; the board is a single
device-lifetime instance. Each show may wait up to one refresh period; refresh
continues autonomously between calls, including while flash writes run.

Saturation, gamma, brightness, correction and tint follow NG ColorGrade's
ordering. A 14-bit LUT preserves panel precision instead of first quantizing
to an 8-bit intermediate canvas. Gamma is applied **once**, using the NG gamma
setting (default 1.9), replacing Pimoroni's fixed 2.2 curve. Brightness and color
balance scale linear light **after** gamma, unlike the upstream brightness
pre-scale. There is no second fixed gamma curve. Manual and automatic brightness
use the shared NG periphery service (median filtering, light curve and smoothing).

## Inputs

The map and pure debounce/step helpers live in `hal/GalacticUnicornDisplay.h`.
All buttons are active low with internal pull-ups and 35 ms debounce. A held
button acts once, not repeatedly; release and press again for another step.

| Input | GPIO | Function |
|---|---|---|
| A / B / C | 0 / 1 / 3 | Left / select / right |
| D | 6 | Unmapped |
| Sleep | 27 | Display power toggle |
| Volume up / down | 7 / 8 | `buzzerVolume` +/- 5, clamped 0–100 |
| Brightness up / down | 21 / 26 | `brightness` +/- 10, clamped 0–255; disables auto brightness |
| Light sensor | 28 (ADC2) | Automatic brightness |

ADC2 supplies native 12-bit counts (0–4095), not lux. Cover/uncover the sensor
with `autoBrightness` enabled to check the shared light curve and configured
min/max brightness and smoothing. Brightness keys select manual mode through
the same settings dispatcher as an API change. Volume keys use the onboard tone
channel setting (`buzzerVolume`); no audio sink is implemented yet, so there is
no audible output. DFPlayer/MP3/radio volume settings are not changed.

A goes to the previous app, C to the next (subject to NG rotate/swapButtons and
blockNavigation). B dismisses a notification; a double press within 300 ms
toggles power unless navigation is blocked. The shared periphery emits the same
`ButtonsChanged` state and left/middle/right callback names as Ulanzi. D is unmapped.
Extra keys dispatch `SetSettings` or `SetDisplay`, emitting normal settings/power
events; settings persist through the existing delayed LittleFS save. Power is
runtime-only, like the API, and fades out/in with NG's power animator; this is not
deep sleep. Button input continues while the panel is off.

The current Pico build has Wi-Fi, but MQTT/HA delivery and HTTP button
callbacks await the transport phase. Their source state/events are shared with
ESP32, not a private button protocol. ESP32's HTTP callback adapter is unchanged;
Pico networking must install its own `PeripheryService::setButtonPost` adapter.

ESP32 and Pico register the same `core/BuiltinCatalog.h`: five apps, nineteen
effects and six overlays, including the same palette-enabled subset. Missing
battery/environmental sensors still hide their apps. Boot logs print these
capability lists. With default settings expect Time 00:00/calendar 1, then Date
01.01.24 while the clock is unset. After NTP sync they show local time/date.
Saved settings may differ.

## Wi-Fi and setup (F5)

The shared `NetworkService` loads stored Wi-Fi credentials and uses the same
boot timeout (15 seconds by default), five-second reconnect checks, weak-signal
roam policy and thirty-second AP retry interval as ESP32. AP retries pause while
a phone is attached. The Pico adapter restores AP+STA mode after each retry
(the pinned core's join changes its mode to STA), keeping captive DNS alive.
Static IP uses Pico's different argument order and configures both DNS servers.
Pico uses the core's worldwide country default and no-low-power mode, rather
than ESP32's country/scan/sort APIs; strongest-BSSID selection is core-dependent.

On a fresh boot without credentials, expect the boot logo followed by the
animated rainbow **AP MODE** screen. A phone sees an open SSID
**awtrixng-xxxxxx**, where `xxxxxx` is the last three MAC bytes in lowercase hex
(or the configured hostname). DHCP and wildcard captive DNS use **192.168.4.1**.
Hold **B / SELECT** for one second at boot to force this mode without erasing
credentials. The render priority matches ESP32: power animation, moodlight,
AP screen, Art-Net, normal apps.

After a successful STA boot, mDNS publishes `<hostname>.local`, `_http._tcp`
and `_awtrixng._tcp` on the configured web port (default 80), with the same
`id` (lowercase MAC without colons), `name` and `type=awtrixng` TXT records.
LEAmDNS is polled every loop. These records match ESP32, but **HTTP and its
provisioning form are not implemented until F6**: joining the AP cannot save
credentials yet and a phone may report no Internet/no working portal.

## Time, reset and sleep

The configured POSIX `tz` and `ntpServer` feed the core's asynchronous SNTP
client. It restarts only when either changes, or on a disconnected-to-connected
transition (matching ESP32 reconnect behavior). DNS/NTP retries are asynchronous.
The same `DevicePageClock` as ESP32 converts UTC to local time, including DST;
years before 2020 remain unset. After provisioning in F6, expect AP MODE to go
away and the clock/date to change from placeholders to the configured local
time/date once the NTP server is reachable. No battery-backed clock is assumed.
Effect noise is seeded from Pico SDK `get_rand_32()` hardware entropy at boot.

Reset reporting uses the framework's best-effort cause: power-on → `poweron`,
watchdog → `watchdog`, reboot → `software`, RUN pin/debug → `external`,
brownout → `brownout` when distinguishable, otherwise `unknown`. ESP32 values
are unchanged. Pico boot logs report this reason; the state endpoint is F6.

The shared device command dispatcher queues reboot/sleep/reset and performs it
after the response delay and display power animation, just like ESP32. The Pico
has **no ESP32-style deep sleep with GPIO wake**. Sleep instead blanks the panel
through the display-off callback, enables CYW43 aggressive power saving, and
waits with short yields. The CPU, RAM and panel refresh hardware remain powered;
this is not a low-microamp shutdown. Application/network request handling pauses.
The same requested millisecond duration ends sleep; GPIO27 also wakes it. A key
held on entry must be released before a new press wakes it. Wake reboots the
application like ESP32 deep-sleep wake, but reports `software`, not `deepSleep`.
The ordinary Sleep key display toggle remains separate and does not enter this
timed sleep. Check timer wake and a release/new GPIO27 press on physical hardware.

## UDP services

Both builds include shared discovery (query `FIND_AWTRIXNG` on UDP 4210,
reply `host[:port]` on 4211) and Art-Net on UDP 6454 when `artnet` is enabled.
The Pico binding uses WiFiUDP, preserving the shared protocol implementation.
Art-Net takes over below power/moodlight/AP screens and returns to apps five
seconds after the last frame. Universes start at zero and hold 170 RGB pixels
each, continuing across the 53x11 canvas. The frame buffer is allocated on first
use. HTTP discovery advertises the future F6 server; it does not implement HTTP.

F5b size comparison (Pico W, same compiler/options, 512 KiB LittleFS): UDP
enabled uses **100,784 bytes static RAM / 538,876 bytes flash**. The non-release
`galactic_unicorn_udp_measure` build omits both services and uses **100,644 /
536,908 bytes**: enabling them costs **140 bytes static RAM / 1,968 bytes flash**.
An active 53x11 Art-Net frame additionally needs 2,332 heap bytes for its pixels,
plus WiFiUDP/lwIP packet allocations. Both services fit comfortably; neither is
reported as unavailable. The measurement environment is not a release target.

Hardware acceptance: flash the UF2, check the SSID/AP MODE behavior above,
capture display and CYW43 PIO/SM logs plus `refresh advancing`, then check the
animated boot screen during a stored-credential join. Host tests and firmware
builds cannot establish physical Wi-Fi/display coexistence.

A human must
confirm the GitHub CI result and flash the generated UF2; host tests cannot
establish physical refresh timing, orientation, or absence of visible tearing.

# Galactic Unicorn display

The Pico W/Pico 2 W board drives the fixed 53x11 panel using the display half
of Pimoroni pico **v1.23.0** (`3440ab232cdc2b019bb8d16f67b0448502efd9dc`, MIT).
Audio and pico_graphics are not included. See `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

## Height and wiring

`panelHeight` defaults to **11**. **8** produces a 53x8 canvas letterboxed on
physical rows **1–8** (zero-based); rows **0, 9, 10** remain dark. Any other
height uses 11 and logs a warning at board startup. Width is always 53, with
one panel and fixed wiring (arbitrary matrix layouts are not supported).

Clock/data/latch/blank are GPIO 13/14/15/16, row selects GPIO 17–20. The
physical stream reverses both axes, matching Pimoroni's original driver.

## Refresh and color

One dynamically claimed PIO SM and two chained DMA channels continuously
refresh fourteen binary-weighted bit planes without CPU refresh interrupts.
PIO1 is preferred to leave PIO0 instruction memory for CYW43; allocation checks
both free SMs and program space, and can fall back to PIO0. The startup log
prints the actual display PIO/SM and DMA channels. The current bootstrap does
**not initialize Wi-Fi**, so CYW43 has **no PIO assignment yet**. The network
phase must log its actual assignment after initialization; no fixed SM is
reserved or assumed by this driver.

Two aligned 9,240-byte buffers (18,480 bytes total) fit in static RAM. `show()`
packs the inactive buffer, publishes its aligned address, then waits until DMA
has begun reading it before reusing the old buffer. The control channel only
loads a new address at a full-frame boundary. The PIO FIFO preserves ordering
across that boundary. Calls must be serialized on core 0; the board is a single
device-lifetime instance. Each show may wait up to one refresh period; refresh
continues autonomously between calls, including while flash writes run.

Saturation, gamma, brightness, correction and tint follow NG ColorGrade's
ordering. A 14-bit LUT preserves panel precision instead of first quantizing
to an 8-bit intermediate canvas. Gamma is applied **once**, using the NG gamma
setting (default 1.9), replacing Pimoroni's fixed 2.2 curve. Brightness and color
balance scale linear light **after** gamma, unlike the upstream brightness
pre-scale. There is no second fixed gamma curve. Manual brightness is wired
in this phase; automatic brightness awaits the light sensor in F4b.

## Input pins (F4b)

These constants are declared in `hal/GalacticUnicornDisplay.h` but inputs are
not implemented by this display-only phase:

| Input | GPIO | Planned function |
|---|---|---|
| A / B / C | 0 / 1 / 3 | Left / select / right |
| D | 6 | Unmapped |
| Sleep | 27 | Display power toggle |
| Volume up / down | 7 / 8 | NG volume |
| Brightness up / down | 21 / 26 | NG brightness |
| Light sensor | 28 (ADC2) | Automatic brightness |

The hardware validation and full `ci-local.sh all` run follow F4b. A human must
confirm the GitHub CI result and flash the generated UF2; host tests cannot
establish physical refresh timing, orientation, or absence of visible tearing.
